                <p>John O'Reilly was <b>born in the slums of Carlow in 1956.</b> He amassed a fortune by moving to Dublin, and teaching people how to drive tractors. He had <b>7 siblings, 2 mothers and 3 fathers and 8 dogs as well as 9 cats.</b> This would all change when he would finish his apprenticeship in mechanics and open his own car dealership in 1985. When he was 7, He was ruthless! He was dangerous. And as the name implies, very irish. He had a reputation for pulling off heists using only his bare hand, he beat Ian Hawk in an arm wrestle and can take apart two 2x1 flat lego pieces apart with his fingers. Ah, but sadly, like all the greats, John O'Railly was gone too soon. He died in the most macho way possible: riding a shark with 250 pounds of dynamite strapped to his chest into the mouth in an active volcano, but he lived!. After selling many cars to many wealthy people in south dublin, he would grow to fame and show off his car collection. </p>
                <p>We pride ourselves in presenting John O'Reilly's collective cars, ranging from vintage to modern prestige. View various vehicles ranging from the Ferrari 250 GTO to the modern 2025 Chevrolet Corvette E-Ray. In 1987, he teamed up with his 5th brother Ja-mee to build his prestige and fame as well as with marketing help from their 3rd sister Jolene. They were not without hardship though as they had to outcompete Lightning McQueen's Rust-eze and with the combined help of the Autobots and the Decepticons, they were able to vanquish their opponent's manager and investor, Unicron as well as the recently resurrected Dracula. Their wealth though came from a lucrative sponsorship by two royal families, Bowser and Princess toadstool of the Mushroom Kingdom to supply the Mario Kart Races. This deal brought them across the world and other worlds.</p>
                <p>John's inspiration to get into the automobile industry came from his passion at a young age. He loved watching Wacky Races and seeing all the different cars race against each other. After Wacky Races, he would watch Formula 1 and various other international racing competitions as well as Transformers.</p>
