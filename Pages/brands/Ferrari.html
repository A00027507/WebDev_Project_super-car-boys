                <p>The <b>1963</b> Ferrari 250 GTO is a legendary and highly valuable V12-powered sports car, known for its racing success and scarcity, with only 36 ever built between <b>1962 and 1964</b>. Its design, a collaboration between Giotto Bizzarrini and Sergio Scaglietti, is considered timeless, contributing to its status as one of the most desirable collector cars, with some private sales reaching over $70 million.</p>

                <p>The <b>1957</b> Ferrari 335 Sport Scaglietti is a legendary and rare sports racing car known for its powerful V12 engine, high top speed (over 180 mph), and historical racing success. One of only four built, it was designed to compete with Maserati and features a sleek, aerodynamic body by Scaglietti. This model is highly sought after, with one car selling for over $35 million at a 2016 auction, making it one of the most expensive cars ever sold at public auction at that time.
