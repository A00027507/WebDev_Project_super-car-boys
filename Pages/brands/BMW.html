                    <p>The new <b>BMW 3 Series</b> was launched - as the successor to the 02 model series - only in a single bodywork style: as a two-door sedan. The styling followed the new line of Chief Designer Paul Bracq which had already been applied to the BMW 5 Series.</p>

                    <p>The two-door <b>3 Series Coupé (E36)</b> appeared for the first time as an independent version alongside the sedan, which was now only available as a four-door model. It was launched in the marketplace in <b>1992</b> and was discontinued in <b>1998</b>.</p>

                    <p>From <b>1993</b>, the BMW 3 Series (E36) was also supplied in a full convertible version alongside the Topcabriolet from Baur, which had been available for some time. The contours were similar to those of the coupé with the flatter engine.</p>
